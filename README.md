<h1>Hi üëã, I'm Laurensius Adrian Wibowo</h1>


I'm a professional software engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Economics (Marketing and Business Management), and I'm passionate about technology and learning new things. I currently work at the largest e-commerce company in Indonesia as a backend software engineer (using Golang) with over 4 years of experience. Additionally, I contribute to helping young tech talent achieve their goals by working at an education tech company as a mentor. My diverse background in marketing and my passion for software engineering have equipped me with a unique perspective and a problem-solving approach. I thrive in collaborative environments and am adept at bridging the gap between technical teams and business objectives. 
I'm also passionate about UI Design, Product Management, Microservices, Golang, and Node.js. I want to help create a better world through technology. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any innovative ideas to turn this dream into reality!
